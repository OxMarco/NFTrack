# NFTrack
Keep an eye on your environmental footprint with a dynamic and personalised work of art

## Abstract
Use a dynamic NFT in a modern and elegant digital frame to represent users' environmental impact and push them towards a more eco-friendly way of life.

## Description
Educating people to the dangers of overconsumption is a really hard topic. For decades scientists have been warning us on the risks and challenges environmental problems are posing us now and will keep growing in the next future.

The environment is frequently seen as a politics-related issue and pushed to the backseat of school educational plans by managers and guardians just to reclaim votes from the part of their electorate who cares about green policies. However, at its roots, our obligation as humans towards the planet is an extensively shared, politically neutral problem, similar in front of the law as pollution in a developing country must count the same as an already developed one. We give for granted people will understand what's wrong and what should be done for the environment by looking at first glance at the proofs given us on a daily basis by reporters, green advocates and scientists like the progressive desertification, the melting of icebergs, the CO2 increase and global depapueration of wildlife. Yet for the vast majority of people such problems aren't seen so close to them nor they represent something worth taking action from the small and (not) insignificant individual level.

This is where NFTrack comes into play. We want to use NFTs as a mean to raise awareness and become a beacon of change by involving users on an emphatic level. Thus, by changing the image from joyful and relaxing to a gloomy and creepy one, the NFT will be a direct representation of the user behaviour and contextually help towards making better life choices.

## Technology behind
The project consists of a hardware part and a software part that work in conjunction to create a smooth and simple overall user experience.

### Hardware
The hardware consists of a recycled PLA digital frame with a modern design connected to the WiFi and constantly listening to update events from the Ethereum blockchain.
A QR code at the bottom of the frame links to some useful resources to help users improve their lifestyle and decrease their environmental footprint.

### Software
The NFT is personalised on a single user basis via generative art while thanks to a decentralised oracle it is possible to retrieve information on their eneergy and water consumption. Ideally such approach can be applied to other networks too, like Regen, in order to gamify data visualisation.
A carbon credit token buried in the NFT (a wrapped-NFT) will counterbalance the minting process expenses. Yet we believe the general value of NFTrack will greatly repay the production footprint.

## Team
The team is made of the GitHub repository owner (technical part) and Roberto, a UI expert and designer.
